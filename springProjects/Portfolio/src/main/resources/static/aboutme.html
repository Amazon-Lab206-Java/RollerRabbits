<p>Hi, I'm Cadence, also known as Art de Cadence.
I have been watercolor painting just over a year now, and pottery painting for 8 months.
My passion is learning new things, experimenting with new techniques.
I'm all about the details, as you can see from my tiny tiles and tiny teacups collection.</p>

<p>When I am not in the studio, you can find me coding. Coding is a new hobby I picked up October of 2017.
It is a very useful skill so far and I'm spending a lot of time on it.
I have learned Python and Java.
